  <h1>ANIMAL SHELTER</h1>
  <h2>Help pets and people in your community</h2>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>The world can be a stressful place, but pets fill it with love. From a cat helping a senior feel less lonely to a dog providing emotional support for a veteran, pets and people form powerful bonds. Pets are part of our families and our communities.</p>
    <p>When people struggle, so do their pets. You can help families in your community stay together. #BeAHelper</p>
